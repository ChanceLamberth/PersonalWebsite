        My name is Chance and I am a current Master Student at Northeastern University studying computer Science. 
        I was working for a large asset manager in Boston and realized that this is what I didn't want to do. I found an opportunity at 
        Northeastern that took in students who did not have experience in computer science and taught them how to program, work with design 
        patterns, learn some algorithms, and a whole lot more. This program has changed the way I view the world and put me on a happier path.

        <strong>A little about me... </strong>

        <br><br>
        Throughout most of my life I have always played or practiced one sport or another. 
        I started with baseball when I was four and decided to move on to running. Running, 
        like computer science, has changed my life. I started running in 7th grade and finally stopped in March 2020 when the Pandemic 
        hit and cut my collegiate season short. Although, no pun intended, it was a good run and I posted some strong times. 
        The highlight of my running career was running one mile in 4:09, a 8k under 24 minutes, and a lot of opportunites to compete across the United States.
